## Tests

When generating tests, use the following style:
- Prefer table-drive tests for functions with multiple test cases.
- Prefer subtests (t.Run) for grouping related test cases.
- Use descriptive names for test cases to clarify their purpose.
- Ensure tests are isolated and do not depend on external state.
